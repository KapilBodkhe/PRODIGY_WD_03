Developed a tic-tac-toe web application by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By implementing functions to handle user clicks, track game state, and check for winning conditions, I created an interactive and engaging tic-tac-toe game. With these technologies and functionalities, users can play against each other or against an AI opponent, aiming to get three markers in a row to win the game.
